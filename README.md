# Project Description

Madlibs is a fun learning tool for people who want to improve their English skills.  Once registered and logged in, 
you can select an age appropriate passage and be prompted for missing words.  After completing all the prompts 
you will be able to read the full passage with your unique additions.  You can then decide to keep your completed 
version for later, or just discard it.  Once played, you can compare your text to those from other users.

- User login / logout.
